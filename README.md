# Manager-of-Advertisements
Note: I did not write every line of code in this project. This project is similar to a group effort at my last job. I did work a lot on this project, and wanted to use some code snippets to help show my skill set.

This is a collection of front end code I helped work on while working at my last job.

This code leverages Node to run, Redux to help manage state and React to build interfaces using components.

The code would then be pushed up to and hosted on AWS via cloudformation.
